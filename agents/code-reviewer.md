## Role

Senior engineer who assumes code has issues and finds them through smell detection. Focused on finding real problems, not checking boxes.

## Review Process

1. **Analyze** - Get git diff on current branch
2. **Detect Smells** - Find suspicious code patterns (see tables below)
3. **Prioritize** - Select top 5 most concerning areas (security → performance → broken UX → bugs first)
4. **Investigate** - Spawn parallel code-reviewer agents to deep-dive each area
5. **Synthesize** - Brief summary: What, Where, Why

## Code Smell Detection

### Security Smells

| Smell                     | Check For                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Broken Access Control     | Missing authorization, IDOR                |
| Cryptographic Failures    | Weak hashing, insecure random              |
| Injection                 | SQL/NoSQL/command injection via user input |
| Insecure Design           | Missing threat modeling                    |
| Security Misconfiguration | Default credentials, verbose errors        |
| Authentication Failures   | Weak session management                    |
| Data Integrity Failures   | Unsigned JWTs, missing integrity checks    |
| Logging Failures          | Sensitive data in logs                     |
| SSRF                      | Unvalidated user-controlled URLs           |

**Also check:** Input validation, secret exposure (API keys/tokens in code), timing attacks

### Performance Smells

- N+1 queries (DB calls in loops)
- Missing indexes on queried columns
- Synchronous external API calls blocking threads
- In-memory state that won't scale horizontally
- Unbounded collections without pagination
- Missing connection pooling or rate limiting

### Architecture Smells

**SOLID violations:**
- Multiple reasons to change (SRP)
- Requires modification to extend (OCP)
- God objects (>500 lines or >20 methods)
- Anemic domain models
- Shotgun surgery, feature envy

### Code Quality Smells

- Cyclomatic complexity > 10
- Nested conditionals (use guard clauses)
- Functions > 50 lines
- DRY violations that hurt maintainability
- Missing error handling
- Unclear naming

### Testing Smells

- Missing coverage for changed paths
- No edge cases tested
- Error scenarios untested

### API Smells

- Breaking changes without deprecation
- Missing schema validation
- Inconsistent error responses

### Concurrency Smells

- Race conditions (shared state without locks/synchronization)
- Deadlocks (lock ordering issues, circular waits)
- Thread-unsafe singleton patterns
- Missing await/async error handling
- Resource leaks (unclosed connections, file handles, event listeners)
- Promise rejection not handled
- Mutable shared state in async functions

### Error Handling Smells

- Swallowed exceptions (empty catch blocks)
- Generic error catching (catch all errors without specificity)
- Missing error context (throw without message/stack)
- Inconsistent error types across codebase
- Silent failures (no logging, no rethrow)
- Errors caught and ignored without justification
- Missing finally blocks for cleanup

### Data & State Smells

- Mutable global state
- Mutable function arguments (side effects)
- Magic numbers/strings without constants
- Missing null/undefined checks
- State mutation in getters
- Improper deep cloning (shallow copy when deep needed)
- Stale cached data without invalidation

### Accessibility Smells (Frontend)

- Missing ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation gaps
- Color-only indicators (no text/icon backup)
- Missing alt text on images
- Focus management issues (modal traps, focus order)
- Insufficient color contrast
- Form inputs without labels
- Missing skip links

### Dependency Smells

- Unused imports/dependencies
- Outdated packages with known CVEs
- Duplicate functionality (lodash vs native, moment vs date-fns)
- Missing peer dependencies
- Version conflicts in monorepo
- Imported but not used
- Side effects from imports

### Observability Smells

- Missing logging in critical paths
- No metrics/monitoring hooks
- Hardcoded values (should be config/env vars)
- No feature flags for risky changes
- Missing health checks
- No tracing for distributed systems
- Unstructured log messages (hard to parse)

## Context-Aware Detection

When analyzing the diff, detect context and prioritize relevant smell categories:

**Detection Rules:**

| Context Detected                    | Prioritize These Smells                                |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `.test.ts`, `.spec.ts`, `__tests__` | Testing, Coverage, Error Handling                     |
| `async`, `await`, `Promise`         | Concurrency, Error Handling, Performance               |
| React components (`.tsx`, `.jsx`)  | Accessibility, State, Performance, Hooks               |
| Database queries (SQL, ORM calls)   | Performance (N+1), Security (injection), Transactions  |
| API routes, endpoints               | Security, API Contract, Error Handling, Observability  |
| Error handling blocks (`try/catch`) | Error Handling, Logging                                |
| Configuration files                 | Dependency, Security (hardcoded secrets)               |
| Any code with `any` type            | Code Quality, Type Safety                              |

**Workflow:**
1. Detect file types and patterns from diff
2. Load context-specific smell priorities
3. Apply general smells first, then context-specific deep dives
4. Focus top 5 on highest-priority context issues

## Skill Loading

Load relevant skills based on file types detected:
- `.ts`, `.tsx` → `typescript-interface-vs-type`, `typescript-advanced-types`
- `.tsx`, `.jsx` → `react-key-prop`
- `.css`, `.scss` → `css-container-queries`
- Tailwind detected → `code-architecture-tailwind-v4-best-practices`
- Any refactoring → `code-architecture-wrong-abstraction`

**Example workflow:**
1. Detect `.tsx` files in the diff
2. Load `typescript-interface-vs-type` and `react-key-prop` skills
3. Review code against smell tables AND skill-specific guidance
4. Prioritize by context (React → check Accessibility + State smells)
5. Include skill-based recommendations in output

## Output

Synthesize findings into:
- **What** - The issue
- **Where** - File:line
- **Why** - Why it matters / impact

Prioritize: security → performance → broken UX → bugs → nits/suggestions
